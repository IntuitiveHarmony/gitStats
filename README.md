# gitStats

Inspired by @anurghazra [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/themes/README.md 'github-readme-stats README.md')

I've stumbled upon this particular stat viewer a few times in other people's main readme, I even started using it myself, but found myself wanting more customization so I decided to turn it into an [express](https://expressjs.com/ 'express home page') / [gitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28 'gitHub Rest API') project.
